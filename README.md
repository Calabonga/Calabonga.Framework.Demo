# Calabonga.Framework.Demo
How do I access a database without much effort? How do I apply a repository and a working template unit? This article describes Calabonga.EntityFramework assembly, which will largely could be simplify some aspects. You can use this publication as a guide for this build.

"Correct" or "Good"
Usually, before embarking on the implementation of the business logic of any application, site, program, you must perform a lot of routine work. And when using the "Correct" approach, the complexity of implementation is multiplied. There are two ways to program, regardless of the platform: the first is "correct", the second is "good". The first method involves the use of different infrastructure patterns, design patterns, SOLID and DRY approaches, abstractions, OOP, and other code development laws and rules. The second way is usually called the "spaghetti code". What is Calabonga.EntityFramework? This is a nuget package that contains abstractions for the implementation of the "Repository level", which is described in the post "Application architecture: conceptual layers and arrangements for their use". In this post I'll going to talk about the Calabonga.EntityFramework library. The principles and rules of its use with examples and explanations.
